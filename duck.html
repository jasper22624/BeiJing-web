            <h1>Peking Duck</h1>
            <p>
                Peking duck is a visually stunning dish with a rich, flavorful profile. The duck is known for its shiny, crispy skin, which is golden-brown and crackles when you bite into it. Beneath the skin, the meat is succulent and juicy, offering a savory contrast to the crisp exterior.<br><br>When served, the dish often includes thin, delicate pancakes that resemble tortillas, hoisin sauce, and fresh scallions. Diners typically assemble their own wraps, layering slices of duck with the sauce and scallions for a burst of flavor in each bite.<br><br>The preparation process is intricate, involving air-drying the duck to ensure a crisp skin and roasting it in a way that enhances its flavor. This meticulous attention to detail contributes to its status as a hallmark of Chinese cuisine. Overall, Peking duck is not just a meal; itâ€™s an experience that combines texture, flavor, and tradition.
