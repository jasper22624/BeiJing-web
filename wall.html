            <h1>Great Wall</h1>
            <p>
                The Great Wall of China, an iconic symbol of Chinese history and culture, stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Originally built to protect against invasions, its construction began as early as the 7th century BC, with various dynasties contributing to its development. The wall features a mix of materials, from tamped earth to bricks, depending on the region and era.<br><br>One of the most famous sections is near Beijing, where visitors can explore well-preserved areas like Badaling and Mutianyu. These sections offer breathtaking views and a glimpse into the ingenuity of ancient engineering. Walking along the Great Wall is not just a physical journey; it’s a historical experience that connects visitors to China’s rich past.
